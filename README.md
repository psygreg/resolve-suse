# resolve-suse
Simplified installation script for DaVinci Resolve on openSUSE. Currently works with Resolve version 19.1.3, both free and Studio.

## Usage

- `git clone https://github.com/psygreg/resolve-suse.git`
- Download the .zip installer file from BlackmagicDesign's website and copy it to `resolve-suse` folder.
- `chmod +x resolve-suse.sh`
- `./resolve-suse.sh`

### Do not close the script. It will close itself once all tasks are completed.
You can safely delete the *"resolve-suse"* folder after completion.
